# Abbreviations in code

Giving good names to variables, functions and files can be difficult.
Long names are always clear, but take time to read, space and are hard to remember.
Choosing a shorter form is better.
If you use the abbreviations below, your naming will become more coherent, logical and understandable to other programmers (even newbies).
